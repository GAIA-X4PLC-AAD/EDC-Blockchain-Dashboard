# EDC Data Dashboard

**Please note: This repository does not contain production-grade code and is only intended for demonstration purposes.**

**This fork was modified to work for the specific demonstration of connecting the EDC to the tezos-edc-interface.**

EDC Data Dashboard is a dev frontend application for [EDC Data Management API](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector).

## Docker image

Pre-built docker images can be found in the following Repository: [DataDashboard Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/johann1999/data-dashboard/general)

Provide environment variables in the docker run command in order to modify the Data Management Url or the Data Catalog Url.

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:80 -e DATA_MANAGEMENT_URL="http://localhost:8182/api/v1/data" -e CATALOG_URL="http://localhost:8181/api/federatedcatalog"  johann1999/data-dashboard:linux-env
```

## Documentation

In order to try the demonstration, you need to run three applications:

1. [EDC Provider](https://github.com/JulianLegler/DataSpaceConnector)
2. [Tezos-EDC Interface](https://github.com/johannha/edc-interface/tree/w/indexer)
3. [Frontend](https://github.com/johannha/DataDashboard/tree/main)

### Steps:

- Clone EDC-Interface and switch to the “w/indexer” branch.
  Follow readme instructions of edc-interface and don't forget to add the Pinata env variable. Finally run the API with `npm run serve`.

- Clone this Data Dashboard Fork and run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular globally.

- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

- Run `npm run start-edc` to start provider part of the EDC (Java must installed locally). An EDC instance should now be running which implements an extension accessing the blockchain by using the Tezos client provided by EDC-Interface. Source code for this EDC version can be found in this [EDC Fork](https://github.com/JulianLegler/DataSpaceConnector).

- Run `npm run start` to host angular frontend

## Support

If there are any problems with installation or deployment, you can write me a mail:

If you have any questions regarding the Tezos Client API implementation, feel free to contact me:

## Motivational Aspects

- Extend EDC functionality by managing and storing assets, policies and contract offerings as NFTs on Tezos blockchain
- Data of assets etc. should be included inside token’s metadata to ensure integrity during negotiation phase
- Implement a blockchain interface to realize minting and token querying functionality
- Optimize token request by adding blockchain indexer → lower response time
- Visualize process of asset, policy and contract offer creation in Data Dashboard → extension and modification is needed

## Outlook

- reach higher level of decentralization and independency:
  - replace Pinata API with individual running IPFS nodes
  - replace TzKT API by running a full blockchain node and further implement lightweight blockchain indexer
- enrich blockchain interface functionality to comply with EDC processes:
  - delete/burn tokens (assets, policies and contract offers)
  - transfer tokens to map asset transfer after negotiation phase
  - link identity management to tokens
- analyze operation costs
